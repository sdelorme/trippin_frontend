    1. Link to a 'live demo.'
    2. I love food and am always recommending places to friends. I built Trippin' to make that a little easier. The app allows you to plan a vacation ("trip") itinerary, search for restaurants or attractions , and save a list of places that you would like to share with others.

    3. This was my first full project built with an external api -- in this case the Google Places API. It was a great way to gain experience with large objects -- and specifically how to handle data with so many null values. A couple of fun/small learning experiences:
    --> Next page tokens
    --> Datetime binding
    --> Serialization of objects to JSON

    4. If I were to start all over I would certainly put more emphasis on wireframing and creating an entire db schema, including how to handle missing data.

### Built With

1. [Backend: Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)

## Features

<!-- TODO: List what specific 'user problems' that this application solves. -->

    --> Users can sign up and log in to an account.
    --> Trippin allows users to search for, and gather information on, any place (attraction, restaurant, business) anywhere in the world. The app will return up to 40 of the closest places based on your search and display their ratings etc..
    --> Trippin allows users to plan itineraries by adding these places to a planned trip. Users can then organize their itinerary chronologically to keep track of their trip.
    --> Users can save "trips" or lists of places to their account for future reference -- EX./ "Best Breweries in Boston".
